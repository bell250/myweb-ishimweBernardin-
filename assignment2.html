	OPTICS:
Under ordinary situations, light travels in straight lines.
This reasonable assumption has led to a ray model. 
The straight line paths followed by light are called light rays.
The ray model is formed very successful in explaining phenomena
like reflection, refraction and formation of images by mirrors and lenses.
Since these explanations involve straight line rays at various angles,
it is called geometric optics or ray optics.
A knowledge of the properties of light allows us 
to understand the blue color of the sky and the design of optical devices
such as telescopes, microscopes, cameras, eyeglasses, and the human eye.
